# Slime-Realm
GitHub Repo for my first collaborative Godot project.



Slime Realm is an Indie 2D Platformer game. The main objective is to defeat the Final Boss. The Hero will have many weapons to his arsenal, mainly Melee Attacks. As the name suggests, the enemies will be Slimes, and the Boss will be Slime related. The game will look similar to Terraria, and play similar to Hollow Knight, with less complex movement. The game will act like a small Metroidvania - with different Scenes the Hero can enter to gain access to different weapons.
